On September 3, 2019 I started graduate school in the [Interactive Telecommunications Program](http://itp.nyu.edu) (ITP) at New York University (NYU). I will be documenting my progress throughout the program on this blog. This week's blog post includes updates and assignments from the introductory courses to Physical Computing, Computational Media and Fabrication.
