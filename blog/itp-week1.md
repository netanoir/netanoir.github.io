title: ITP Week 1
---

On September 3, 2019 I started graduate school in the [Interactive Telecommunications Program](http://itp.nyu.edu) (ITP) at New York University (NYU). I will be documenting my progress throughout the program on this blog. This week's blog post includes updates and assignments from the introductory courses to Physical Computing, Computational Media and Fabrication.

This post is a work-in-progress ðŸ˜…

### Physical Computing
For Physical Computing taught by Danny Rozin, we were assigned the first two chapters of the [Art of Interactive Design](http://proxy.library.nyu.edu/sso/skillport?context=4587) by Chris Crawford and "[A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/)" by Bret Victor to read. You can read my reflections on these readings once I actually finish reading them.

### Computational Media
In Introduction to Computational Media (ICM), Cassie Tarakajian introduced us to [p5.js](https://p5js.org), a creative coding javascript library which we will be learning how to use and code with this semester. For homework, we are first supposed to create our own screen drawing (for example, self-portrait, alien, monster, etc.) using 2d shapes like `arc()`, `curve()` or `ellipse()`. You can view my sketch [here](#) once I actually complete this homework assignment. 

Second, we're supposed to write about how computation applies to our interests. I'm interested in using computation from a cybernetics standpoint, where learning about (computational) systems will not only help me better understand how to dismantle them, but to create better ones in place. It is my goal to apply my learning in this area to the organizing work I do for abolition with organizations like No New Jails and Survived and Punished.


### Fabrication
For homework we are to build a flashlight. I still have no idea what I'm going to build.
