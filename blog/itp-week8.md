For ICM, Sam Krystal and Neta Bomani worked on [sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/samek/sketches/vCml-7n1z) based on a segment in the Pokemon television series called "Who's That Pokemon?"[^1]

[^1]: [Every single "Who's that Pokemon?" segment on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOLXYAlC-R8)

We were asked to describe the experience in 5-10 words below:
A memory game to flex your nostalgiac fandom for Pokemon.

The sketch is split into 8 sections based on each Pokemon, Bulbasaur, Mewtwo, Jigglypuff, Electrobuzz, Infernape, Squirtle and Vilplume.

We were also asked to describe each section in 2-3 words below:
Section 1: This is Bulbasaur.
Section 2: This is Mewtwo.
Section 3: This is Jigglypuff.
Section 4: This is Electrobuzz.
