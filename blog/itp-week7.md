### Computational Media
This week's homework assignment for ICM we're to document our midterm project. As outlined in my week six blog post, I improved on my previous [sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/netanoir/sketches/9TsSxsCZk) of a redacted FBI Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) file [here](https://editor.p5js.org/netanoir/sketches/xg2kPx5pR).

Title: confirm deny existence nonexistence (cden)

Description: a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) document is presented in front of you with random redactions. how does it make you feel?

Reflection: In the first week of ICM, I wrote, "I'm interested in using computation from a cybernetics perspective, where learning about (computational) systems will not only help me better understand how to dismantle them, but to create better ones in place. It is my goal to apply my learning in this area to the organizing work I do for abolition with organizations like No New Jails and Survived and Punished." I still agree with that statement. In repsonse to the two reflection questions ("Can computation be harmful to you? Can it help you be more creative?"), I do think that computation can be harmful to me. Programmatic thinking, which emphasizes problem solving and looking at parts of whole, can be really frustrating to non-western/european practices, especially my own Afro-centric cultural which functions opposite. Such highly individualized and compartmentalized thinking, while useful in certain contexts, can be really alienating, especially depending on the content. I wish I had done more collaborative coding assignments with my peers because the isolation of this project has been really frustrating, but also I did get help from people like Allison Parrish and Cassie Tarakajian in office hours, and my friend Bomani McClendon. Through those experiences, I learned more about code than in my own individual learning sessions. I also think computation can help me be more creative, but I'm trying to resist the seductive  nature of techno-solutionism, which is extremely difficult inside a technical program.
