This week's blog post includes updates and assignments from the Prediction as Planning and introductory courses to Physical Computing, Fabrication and Computational Media.

This blog post is a work in progress ðŸ˜…

Danny taught us the basics of electricity. We built basic circuits made of up LEDs, resistors powered by Arduino Nano 33 IOTs connected to our laptops. For homework we were to get creative and make a switch. Below is my meta switch, which is a mini zine about switches that functions as the switch connected to my breadboard circuit.
