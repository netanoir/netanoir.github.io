title: ITP Week 2&#58; On Repeat
---

This week's blog post includes updates and assignments from the Prediction as Planning and introductory courses to Physical Computing, Fabrication and Computational Media.

This blog post is a work in progress ðŸ˜… 

### Physical Computing
Danny taught us the basics of electricity. We built simple circuits made of up LEDs, resistors powered by Arduino Nano 33 IOTs connected to laptop computers. For homework we were to get creative and make a switch. Below is my meta switch, which is a mini zine about switches that functions as the switch connected to my breadboard circuit.

### Fabrication
[This week's](https://itp.nyu.edu/fab/intro_fab/week-2-repeatability/) theme in fabrication is _guides, jigs and repeatability_. For homework, we were to make 5 or more multiples of a multi process piece. I've been making a lot of zines this week for the [NY Art Book Fair](https://twitter.com/netabomani/status/1174532078303686658) by [Printed Matter](https://printedmatterartbookfairs.org/) and AI.Assembly for [Stephanie Dinkins](https://www.stephaniedinkins.com/aiassembly.html), so I decided to make something useful to help me with the process: a bookpress. 

Bookpresses are most commonly used in publishing in a couple ways. For example, in bookmaking, bookpresses are used to secure sheets of paper so they can be bound or rebound together to form a book. In zinemaking, bookpresses are also used to secure sheets for binding, in addition to flatten paper folded into zine booklets.

Unfortunately, the shop was closed when I scheduled to work on my project. But, I was able to make it work.

> Setting up my template by marking where I'm going to drill my holes for each of my five bookpresses.

> I started with a smaller bit to see how the wood would react to the bit. I'm still new to this, but I observed that the cheap wood generally liked the small bit. There was little to no splicing or imperfections. After I drilled the small holes, I graduated to a larger bit.

> The reason I needed a larger bit was to fit these carriage screws with a 5/16" inch diameter which will serve as the main component the bookpress jig.

> Here's the carriage screw next to the hole. Let's see if it fits.

> It does! I sandwiched it with a circular washer to add a cushion between the wood and the screw.

> Here's the finished bookpress with some vibrant neon pink zines presssing in between the two wood cutouts fastened with two 5.5 inch carriage screws and wing nuts. Im(press)ive.

> Here's 4 more book presses, altogether a total of five.

When the shop opens up, I hope to take them apart, sand the surfaces and round the corners. Then, I'll stain my wood, polish them, seal them, keep one for myself and give the rest away since I don't need all these presses.

I have a lot of thoughts swirling in my head about handmade goods, Fordism, capitalism, overconsumption, material waste and our dying planet but it's late so I'll process those thoughts later and revisit this blog post.
