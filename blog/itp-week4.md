title: ITP Week 4&#58; Modest Tools
---

This week's blog post includes updates and assignments from the Prediction as Planning and introductory courses to Physical Computing, Fabrication and Computational Media.

This blog post is a work in progress ðŸ˜… 

### Computational Media
This week I'm thinking about how to make text based mediums dynamic. I'm still very inspired by Simone Browne's _Dark Matters_. Here's my work in progress [sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/netanoir/sketches/9TsSxsCZk) of an redacted FBI Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) file.

### Fabrication
Thinking a lot about modest materials and tools, recyclable and sustainable practices in making objects that people from low income backgrounds like myself will find accessible outside of ITP. I made an enclosure out of cardboard with standoffs. I used a box cutter and awl to make it work. Planning on connecting my potentiometer to my this week's computational media sketch to operate as a mouse or slider.
