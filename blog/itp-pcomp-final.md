title: ITP Physical Computing Final Project
---

For my final in the physical computing class, I'm interested playing with text in p5 and physical sensors and/or momentary switches to interrgoate interaction itself, more specificially the interaction of archives through the artifact of [Malcolm X's](https://archive.org/details/MalcolmXFBI) [FOIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)) document. What follows are my general notes and ideas or sites of future exploration:

- I want to find/create a sensor that makes sense as a metaphor to redacting/erasing. For example, a rubber eraser. This might work well with an accelerometer or some kind of pressure sensor.
- I want to extend this beyond the satisfying interaction of drawing black boxes over a text document. How can I bring in different modes of the text itself, and creates switches between them? For example, I want there to be a mode where you only see the redacted text (black boxed and un-black boxed). What other modes or opportunities for comparative analysis are there (not including machine learning or natural language processing.) 
-How can the phsyical compuation itself make a commentary on the black boxing and surveillance of the object?
