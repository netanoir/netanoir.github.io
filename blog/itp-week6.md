title: ITP Week 6&#58; Midterms!!!
---

This week's blog post includes updates and assignments from the introductory courses to Physical Computation, Computational Media and Fabrication.

This blog post is a work in progress ðŸ˜… 


### Computational Media
This week we learned about objects and functions. I improved on my previous [sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/netanoir/sketches/9TsSxsCZk) of a redacted FBI Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) file [here](https://editor.p5js.org/netanoir/sketches/emvBKysRx). See more documentation under "Physical Computation."

### Physical Computation
I connected my FOIA sketch to my arduino with serial communication. Now you can control the redactions with a sensor that is a potentiometer.

### Fabrication
I made a fan zine with a motor with a fan attached to it, cardboard and an accordian fold zine. Documentation coming soon.
