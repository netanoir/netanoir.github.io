title: ITP Week 5&#58; Making functional objects while feeling dysfunctional and burned out from grad school midterm
---

This week's blog post includes updates and assignments from the Prediction as Planning and introductory courses to Fabrication and Computational Media.

This blog post is a work in progress ðŸ˜… 

### Computational Media
This week we learned about objects and functions. I made a [code meme](https://editor.p5js.org/netanoir/sketches/zVpJD0Zz1) about Cardi B and the Pythagorean theorem.

### Fabrication
This week we learned about [materials and fasteners](https://itp.nyu.edu/fab/intro_fab/week-5-materials-and-fastners/). Here's my failed experiment with making jewelry with resin and acyrlic ink! I was able to find some old keys and make earrings out of them.
