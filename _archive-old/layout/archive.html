           <!--  <p> On Dec. 12 and 13, I along with 12 other students in the Fall 2018 cohort at the <a href="http://sfpc.io" target="_blank">School for Poetic Computation</a> exhibited projects in a final showcase to reflect on what we learned during the program.</p>

            <p> Described in short as a prototype of a dark matter object which holds memory, M4SP is a circuit based off of the 1788 Brookes slave ship model comprised of 394 axial lead resistors to represent the many Black people who were crammed into the first of many ships in the middle passage. </p>

            <p> By touching a wire to the metal on the resistors, people interacting with the circuit can trigger a projection of archival media pertaining to the Black liberation movement scraped from archive.org, loc.gov and the curated archive of the circuit builder. </p> -->
