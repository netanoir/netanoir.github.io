On March 2, 2019, [Art+Feminism](http://www.artandfeminism.org/) had its sixth annual [Wiipedia Edit-a-thon](https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/5229), "an all-day communal updating of Wikipedia entries on subjects related to gender, art, and feminism" at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).

On behalf of the [Tech Zine Fair](http://techzinefair.org), [Ritu Ghiya](http://ritu.online/) and I led a zine making workshop at the New York Public Library across the street from MoMA as a part of the event.

Based on an [activity](https://jennyferretti.com/2019/01/23/lesson-plans-be-the-authority-wikipedia-in-the-classroom/) called "Wikipedia on Paper" originally developed by [Maragraet Smith](https://library.nyu.edu/people/margaret-smith/), our workshop extended the idea of editing Wikipedia definitions on notecards, to editing and publishing articles in zines. We specifically looked at articles about ideas, groups and figures which impact underpresented communities regarding technology, race and feminism like [Octavia Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_E._Butler), [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics), [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) and [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias).

We encouraged participants to think criticially and creatively about how we can make information more accessible to people within our communities by using analog editing and peer reviewing techniques given the following prompts:
- How can we work on a zine like we would a Wikipedia article?
- How can you think about subjects, phenomena, and other aspects of our society as a technology?
- How can you break down the laws, scripts and codes that govern our lives?
