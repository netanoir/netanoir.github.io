[Out of the Black Box (OBB)](https://pioneerworks.org/programs/summer-steam-program-out-of-the-black-box/) was a summer workshop series that aimed to help children in grades 2-5 to uncover the magical logic of computation through arts and crafts. Together we built electronic circuits by making sculptures with conductive clay, letters with voice recording modules, and drawings with robots. The activities in this workshop series were designed to encourage participants to produce collaborative works with their peers–emphasizing skills such as teamwork, compromise, and communication. Participants left this workshop series with a basic understanding of electronic circuitry and a deepened exposure to multimedia art-making practices.

OBB is inspired by the 90s children’s TV show Out of The Box. In Out of the Box, teachers Tony and Vivian lead a community of children through interesting arts and crafts activities, while also instilling values about friendship, communication, and relationship-building. We aimed to create a similar environment for values-based exposure to art-making by extending our focus to be inclusive of STEAM education. OBB was taught by [Bomani McClendon](https://bomani.xyz) and Neta Bomani.
