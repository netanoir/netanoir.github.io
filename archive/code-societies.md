I was a co-organizer for the Code Societies winter 2020 session with [emma norton](https://marceldochamp.net) and [Melanie Hoff](https://www.melaniehoff.com/). I taught [Cybernetics of Race/ism and Sex/ism](https://sfpc.io/code-societies/blog/2020-cybernetics-of-race-ism-and-sex-ism.html) with Melanie, conducted an oral history project and designed a zine with [Ritu Ghiya](https://www.ritu.online/) to document the session.
