I made digital illustrations for Omayeli Arenyeka’s article, “[How to think differently about doing good as a creative person](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-think-differently-about-doing-good-as-a-creative-person/),” a guide to avoiding "creative savior complex" when working on social impact projects for *the Creative Independent* with art direction by Willa Köerner.
