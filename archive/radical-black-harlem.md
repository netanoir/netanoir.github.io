I designed the guidebook for the [Radical Black Women of Harlem Walking Tour](http://bcrw.barnard.edu/publications/radical-black-women-of-harlem-walking-tour/) researched and written by Asha Futterman and [Mariame Kaba](http://www.usprisonculture.com/blog/), with a map designed by [Arrianna Planey](https://arriannaplaney.wordpress.com/) and support from the [Barnard Center for Research on Women](http://bcrw.barnard.edu/).
