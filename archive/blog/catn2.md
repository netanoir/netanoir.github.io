title: Hypertext&#x3a; Sketch 2 - Harriet's Internet
---
For the second [sketch](http://catn.decontextualize.com/schedule/) assigned in [Computational Approaches to Narrative](http://catn.decontextualize.com), I started creating a game built with [Twine](https://twinery.org) called Harriet's Internet. The idea was inspired by [Mandy Harris Williams](https://www.mandyharriswilliams.com/), who said they beileved Harriet Tubman created the internet at Cosmic Bodies, a celebration of the release of [Legacy Russell](https://www.legacyrussell.com/)'s [Glitch Feminism](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3668-glitch-feminism). You can play an incomplete version of the game [here](harriets-internet.html).

> The screenshot reads, "Hello Juanita Davis! Welcome back to Harriet's Internet, the North Star for those who came into the world with the desire to be human beings, but instead were found to be things among other things. What is your purpose today? 1) Guide another to the space of time danced through. 2) Return to the space of time danced through."

This game isn't finished largely in part because I got sucked into constructing the narrative form and content of the story (I also went through a few iterations in regards to topic, before serendipitously being inspired by Mandy's comments on a panel). Players are invited to log onto Harriet's Internet as Juanita Davis, a 19 year old Black woman who was freed by Harriet Tubman. Quickly after being freed, Juanita becomes an informant for Harriet.

Following the Sira narrative structure, I'm figuring out how to weave multiple slave narratives together to channel the sense of collective struggle within the character of Juanita Davis, who is a hybrid of Harriet Tubman and every other Black person who Harriet has affected. (Note: Some elements of the story were adapted from the 2019 film [_Harriet_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_(film))). Players will have the opportunity to learn the history of the Black Freedom Struggle by diving into the reflective spaces of Juanita's personal and ancestral memories, while also going on incognito missions where she observes the hold of the plantation and exercises judgement on which slaves can be successfully freed by Harriet's angels through the underground railroad.
