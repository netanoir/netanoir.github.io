title: Formal theories of narrative&#x3a; Sketch 1 - the end of the world in three parts
---
For the first [sketch](http://catn.decontextualize.com/schedule/) assigned in [Computational Approaches to Narrative](http://catn.decontextualize.com), a class taught by Allison Parrish, I created a system for generating stories called “the end of the world in three parts.” The system also had to be based on some kind of formalism or abstraction about narrative.

> Part 1 reads, "in the shine of a deepsong, you see the sunfall. the year is 2726." Part 2: "some entity wants a soundless community. "don't let it touch me! the blackness! lord!" someone whispers to a handy angel in the sky." Part 3: "you feel nothing but serene. meanwhile, a banding insurrection sparks the hold's collapse."

I used [Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) with an add-on called [Text Randomizer](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/text_randomizer/188517091943) to create a three part story following the [monomyth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) narrative structure complicated by an amalgamated meditation on both the etiological oral and Sira narrative structures outlined in “[The Myth of ‘Universal’ Narrative Models](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04028-4_8).” I read the assigned readings before and during the creation of this system and used the process of making the system as an exercise in reflecting on what I read.

To generate a story from the system I constructed:

- Open the [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zyHrdIlNpl85Jskl3mWZhdkvPa-ZVPpCOgsSRciBy1Q/edit#gid=1607038037)
- On the top menu, select `Add ons > Get add-ons`  
- Search for [Text Randomizer](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/text_randomizer/188517091943) and install it
- On the top menu, re-select `Add ons > Text Randomizer  > Open`  
- On the right panel, click the respective buttons (e.g. part 1, 2, 3) to generate a random story
