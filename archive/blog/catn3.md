title: Environmental Storytelling&#x3a; Sketch 3 - How Not to Be Seen
---
For the third [sketch](http://catn.decontextualize.com/schedule/) assigned in [Computational Approaches to Narrative](http://catn.decontextualize.com), I started making a game built with [Bitsy](http://ledoux.io/bitsy/editor.html) inspired by artist and theorist Hito Steyerl's [_How Not To Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File_](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/181784?sov_referrer=artist&artist_id=43752&page=1).

> _How Not To Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File_ (2013)

The original _How Not To Be Seen_ is a video which serves as an instruction manual (albeit, satirical and fantastical) on how to achieve states of invisibility divided into the following tips: 1. Make something invisible for the camera, 2. Be invisible in plain sight, 3. Become invisible by becoming a picture, 4. Be invisible by disappearing, and 5. Become invisible by merging into a world made of pictures. The work is a critical reflection not only on how images are produced, but whether or not it's possible to disappear and escape from surveillance technologies and social media. In an [interview](http://www.berlinartlink.com/2013/11/19/interview-hito-steyerl-zero-probability-and-the-age-of-mass-art-production/), Steyerl asks, "How do people disappear in an age of total over-visibility?…Are people hidden by too many images?…Do they become images?"
