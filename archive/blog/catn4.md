title: Interactive Fiction and world models&#x3a; Sketch 4 - The Capsule
---
For the fourth [sketch](http://catn.decontextualize.com/schedule/) assigned in [Computational Approaches to Narrative](http://catn.decontextualize.com), I started making an interactive fiction game built with [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/). The game is set in a capsule in a void at a near to distant future or perhaps, parallel universe. The player plays as an unnamed entity who lives in the capsule, which has a window, a desk and a slot which are the focus of the game. The desk is where the entity works, or analyzes objects that come from the void through the slot. Through the entities work, the player comes to understand the character and the world in which they live.

My goal with this game is to create a meta hypertext game wherein players are reading text within the interactive fiction itself and engaging in a citational hypertext practices such as footnotes, highlights, underlines, annotations and scribbles on the texts and artifacts that "randomly" come through the slot. I'm interested in exploring how reading or close reading is or can be game-like. Since I'm including texts I've read more than once in the story, it is also useful for me to understand how I read and how my previous markings on the reading impact future readings and understandings of the text.

You can play an incomplete version of the game [here](the-capsule/index.html).
