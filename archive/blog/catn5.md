title: Simulation and Narrative&#x3a; Sketch 5 - NaNoGenMo project
---
For the fifth [project](http://catn.decontextualize.com/schedule/) assigned in [Computational Approaches to Narrative](http://catn.decontextualize.com), I made a computer generated play in the spirit of [National Novel Generation Month](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo). The play is concerned with gesturing towards a speculative anthology of generative Black feminist autotheory. I read a lot of Black feminist literature, especially for [my thesis](../m4sp.html). In reading all the scholars, theorists, non fiction writers, fiction writers, poets, philosphers and thinkers, I like to imagine all of them getting together and talking about the very things they write about.

When it comes to Black feminist literature, I'm especially drawn to the autotheoretical elements that often inform the work. For example, Saidiya Hartman's _Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Riotous Black Girls, Troublesome Women and Queer Radicals_, Hortense Spiller's _Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe: An American Grammar Book_, and Toni Morrison's _The Bluest Eye_. **Autotheory** is a framework which foregrounds subjective and autobiographical material as the basis for generating theory. While autotheory is deeply informed by autobiography, autotheory is not synomymous with or irreducible to autobiography. 

I'm inspired by the work of Black feminist playwrights Anna Deavere Smith (_Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other Identities_) and Nikki Yeboah (_The (M)others_). Both playwrights blend oral history and peformance in a way that blurs the distinction between the two. [Oral history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_history) can serve as research to support autotheories.

For this project, I'm interested in how I can collaborate with computers, more specifically the Python programming language, [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) natural language processing tool and [Tracery](https://tracery.io/) grammar to write Black feminist [autofiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofiction) where the real life identities of the cast of characters is preserved in the way that they're named, but fictionalized by the content of what the characters say, think or do in hopes of speculating a dialectic that could potentially create a kind of computational autotheory.

In the near future, I will fine-tune this project with a [GPT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI#GPT-2) text-generating machine learning model which will be trained on the same corpora.
